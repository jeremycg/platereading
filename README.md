#platereading
============

r script for reading plates off a bioanalyser to give curve parameters as an output.
Plates are fit to the buchanan curve by nls (there will be bad fits) and the parameters output for further analysis.

Takes input of a directory of directories of reads. The main directory must have one directory, labelled "Plate xx", for each run. Capital P is important on *nix systems. These directories must contain the .csv files given by the bioanalyser software, labelled xxx.csv, where xxx is the time in hours the reading was taken.
Additionally, the root directory must contain a "strainlist.csv" which has run, column, strain and temperature columns.

The shiny app allows visualisation of data based on residual cutoffs, and plots of individual fits. It is independant of the other files - they contain functions for running individual parts of the analysis.
Two .csvs are generated by the shiny app - grouped.csv, a file with means and sds of each parameter, based on a cutoff residual of 0.1. The other is outputfits.csv, which has one line for each well.

usage:
Run the shiny app. runApp("shiny") from the directory containing the shiny folder. Choose the directory which contains your data. If you already have a outputfits.csv (ie you corrected it) put it in the folder and it will not create a new one
choose.dir() function is currently only working on windows machines - you can manually correct the setwd() call for other systems. 

##todo:
* More intelligent handling of bad fits
* residuals based on number of time points
* fix choose.dir() function - appears to break on some systems
